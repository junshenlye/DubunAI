This is Open Sourced, this allows you to create multiple exploration path and also allows you to map back context windows allowing you to have more control over the outcome.

Currently its is a bare bone feature (No Auth, No Planning, No tools).
We will continue to try add this on a later time.


Feature concept:
Allow context window management and allow user to explore different path without the fear of lost context window or corrupted context window. It allows user to be more daring in exploring with LLMs as most importantly have a better experience from LLMs.

Potential Future use cases:
User can generate planning easily by exploring multiple potential decision without weaken and expensive context window. With more different approaches, the user can actually get a better outcome while consuming lesser tokens in a long run inside a conventional LLM context window.
